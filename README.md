# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
### In this analysis we aim to visualize ride-sharing data by city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. After merging the city_data and ride_data csv files into one dataframe, we were able to get the total number of rides, drivers, and total fares for each city type. Using pandas and matplotlib library, we are able to create a line graph of to show the comparison between the average fare per rider and fare per driver in each city. 

## Purpose
### The purpose of this analysis was to create a dataframe summary of ride-sharing in each type of city for the PyBer Ride Share company to reevaluate which cities need improvement. We were able to find the total number of rides, drivers, and fares for each city type, then further our analysis to find the average fare per rider and average fare per driver. Based on how many drivers and riders there are in a particular city, PyBer can gauge what an appropriate fare should be for each ride. Additionally, if there are more riders in a certain city type, then PyBer can see if they need to supply more drivers. 

## Results
### PyBer Summary
#### In the data frame below, we found the total rides, drivers, fares, average ride fare, and average driver fare. Rural cities have the least numer of total rides and drivers, and their average ride fare is significantly higher than urban and suburban cities at $34.62. Urban cities have the highest total rides and drivers, with their average ride fare totaling to $24.53. The total riders in urban cities is 13x the amount in rural cities, which implies that the demand for ride share is much higher in urban cities. Since the demand is higher in urban cities, the price is lower therefore causing a greater influx of riders and drivers in the area. This demand creates a higher profit for PyBer in urban cities. In suburban citites, the number of riders is 5x the amount as rural cities, which also makes it a more profitable city type because the demand is higher.

### Total Weekly Fares by City Type
#### By looking at the line graph for total weekly fares by city. we can see that urban cities generate the largest amount of weekly income since the demand for rides is much higher. The second highest total weekly income is suburban cities, which correlates to our PyBer summary since they have 5x the amount of riders as rural areas.

### Summary
#### From the complete PyBer analysis that we performed, we can see that it is extremeley benefical for PyBer to remain in urban and suburban cities since they generate the most weekly profit. Increasing the number of drivers in urban cities may increase the number of riders as well, since drivers will be more readily avaliable. Although rural cities generate the least amount of money, PyBer could consider decreasing the fare per ride and fare per driver to see if that gives riders a higher incentive in using PyBer ride share. Another way to increase profit would be to supply more drivers on busier days of the week or month, based on the graph. For the most success, the PyBer Ride Share should focus on urban and suburban cities.
